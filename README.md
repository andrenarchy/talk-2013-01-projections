# Projections, angles and spectra in Hilbert spaces

If you are interested: go ahead and [watch the slides](http://andrenarchy.github.io/talk-2013-01-projections)! :)

### Abstract
In this talk I will present some fundamental yet very interesting results from the wonderful world of projections, angles between subspaces and spectral perturbation theory in Hilbert spaces.
